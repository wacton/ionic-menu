## This repo shows the styling issue with UWP apps & Ionic Menu

- Run *ionic cordova run windows* (On a windows machine)
- When app runs, hit Toggle Menu
- Move mouse pointer from bottom all the way up (all the way to the top)
- Notice the lines between Item 1,2,3 not being visible. 
- This seems to be a bit random when it happens, more or less in the middle of the screen
